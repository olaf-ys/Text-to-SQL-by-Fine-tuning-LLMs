Tune the model using datasets with more complex query labels that incorporate window functions, subqueries, CTEs (Common Table Expression), table joins, etc. 2. Add detailed schema and data description to model inputs. 3. Use LLMs with higher capacity 4. Experiment with different combinations of hyper-parameters. 5. Use better evaluation metrics such as execution accuracy and logical form accuracy."
